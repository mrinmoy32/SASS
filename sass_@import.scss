//Sass Importing Files

//You can create small files with CSS snippets to include in other Sass files. Examples of such files can be: reset file, variables, colors, fonts, font-sizes, etc. 

// Just like CSS, Sass also supports the @import directive.

// The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

// The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Sass @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!

//e.g.
@import "variables";
@import "colors";
@import "reset";
